Most Oracle Docker images are only available on the Oracle Container Registry at https://container-registry.oracle.com/.
The main reason for this is the licensing policy whereby Oracle makes the images available under all sorts of terms, starting with
open source licenses, through trial/standard terms, ending with dedicated licenses.

Finally, if the licenses do not suit you, you can create your own images from scratch.
But even with the custom image, you will still need to obtain the licenses for Oracle products the same way as required by Oracle Standard Terms and Restrictions trial end.
