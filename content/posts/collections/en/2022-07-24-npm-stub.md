Maintaining legacy applications written in JS, sooner or later, you will notice during installation that some
packages are marked as deprecated. Sometimes the reason for this is authors discontinuing development in favor of 
newly supported native functions:

> **WARN** deprecated stable\@0.1.8: Modern JS already guarantees Array#sort() is a stable sort, so this library is deprecated. See the compatibility table on MDN: *https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort#browser_compatibility*

Often, replacing such functions with native ones significantly reduces the size of the delivered application and
provides better support in the event of potential errors. Such adaptation is possible thanks to the configuration of
overridden dependencies in the `package.json` file through the [`overrides`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides) field:

```javascript
{
  "overrides": {
    "baz": {
      "bar": {
        "foo": "1.0.0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This operation is safe as long as the new version is compatible with the dependent packages. Keep this in mind when updating dependent packages
(for example, they may suddenly require a version that is not compatible with the package adaptation).
From the above, there is an apparent con of this operation, i.e. the **potential** increase in the difficulty of maintaining the application.

Using the `react-static` package (now in maintenance mode) as an example, I'll show you how to replace the indirect dependency on the `axios`
with the native [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) implementation from the browser or NodeJS:

## Adaptation of the npm package

The [`react-static@7.6.2`](https://github.com/react-static/react-static/blob/v7.6.2/packages/react-static/package.json)
requires the `axios@^0.21.1` package in the dependency tree. However,
only the `axios.get()` function is used in the entire codebase, and only in two places â€“ as a React [hook](https://github.com/react-static/react-static/blob/v7.6.2/packages/react-static/src/browser/hooks/useSiteData.js#L38)
providing page data and for page [prefetch](https://github.com/react-static/react-static/blob/v7.6.2/packages/react-static/src/browser/hooks/useSiteData.js#L38).

Axios is a package that offers much more functionality than the native fetch. At the same time, it supports more browsers. On the other
hand, the fetch function is now also found in the newer browsers. Moreover, it does not impose [an additional size](https://bundlephobia.com/package/axios@0.21.1)
on the application.

By default, after installing the packages needed for `react-static`, you will find the `axios` package in the `node_modules/axios`
directory relative to your project. In order to replace with your own adaptation, I recommend starting with copying the content to
the root of the project. Then, in the package definition, remove unnecessary dependencies and add information about
changes to the original:

```
{
  "name": "axios",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "description": "Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. MODIFIED: Customized as a wrapper for fetch GET.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "author": "Matt Zabriskie",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

The package input file is `index.js` (`module.exports = require ('./ lib / axios');`), indicated by the `main` field.
Referenced `lib/axios.js` source contains the module export. We adapt it by providing an implementation only for the `get()` function
that refers to the native `fetch` function. To keep the default behavior intact, add the `Accept` headers and transform the response to JSON:

```javascript
'use strict';

var axios = {
    get: (path) => {
        return fetch(path, {
            method: "GET",
            headers: {
                'Accept': 'application/json, text/plain, */*'
            }
        })
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => ({data}));
    }
}

module.exports = axios;
```

At the very end, replace the package reference in the `package.json` file under the resolutions field (or
under the `dependencies` field, if you use it directly). A global override with the local adaptation contained in the `src/axios`
directory (invoke the `npm install ./src/axios` command for the automated update of the `dependency` field) will look like this:

```javascript
{
  "resolutions": {
    "axios": "link:src/axios"
  }
}
```

If you add dependencies manually, all you need to do is call npm install to update `package-lock.json`.
Lastly, try to prepare some test cases to cover all use cases of your adaptation.
